## **Motivation**

Data science and mathematical modeling have become key tools to support the management and response to public health emergencies. However, in Latin America and the Caribbean, the availability of educational materials in Spanish remains limited, exacerbated by social, economic, and access barriers to quality open education. Additionally, there is a significant gap in the participation and representation of women in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) disciplines, especially in mathematical modeling, programming, and data science, which restricts the potential for advances in regional public health. Therefore, this e-learning training strategy aims to overcome these barriers by offering high-quality, open-access education through a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course), also promoting gender equity in these fields to ensure more inclusive and effective development in the response to public health emergencies in the region.

## **Objetive**

The main objective of this strategy is to provide open-access educational material in Spanish, specifically adapted to the context of Latin America and the Caribbean, to develop capacities in the region in data science and mathematical modeling of infectious diseases.

## **Target Audience**

This strategy is aimed at professionals and students in fields such as the health sector and STEM areas (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics), as well as individuals involved in public health decision-making.

## **Content**

The development of this strategy includes the creation of a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) that contains short learning units grouped into four main modules:

-   **Epidemic and Epidemiological Theory Module**: Addresses epidemic theory as a fundamental basis for understanding and managing infectious diseases from their history to the science behind them. This module provides the conceptual and analytical tools necessary to understand how diseases spread in human populations, evaluate their impact, and inform informed decision-making for their prevention and control.

-   **Data science in public health Module**: Covers the various stages of the data life cycle, such as data collection, extraction, cleaning, analysis, and visualization. This module focuses on acquiring or strengthening programming skills in the R language.

-   **Outbreak Response Module**: Presents the main knowledge and tools to effectively identify and manage infectious disease outbreak situations. This module includes elements of epidemiological surveillance systems, step-by-step outbreak investigations, effective risk communication, and the role of field and laboratory activities in outbreak response..

-   **Modelling and Analytics Module**: Presents theoretical concepts, practical exercises, and case studies for constructing mathematical models of infectious disease spread, exploring parameters, and statistical applications. This module allows the development of skills to apply advanced analytical techniques in interpreting epidemiological data and making informed decisions in public health situations.

Each of these modules includes several units. Each unit requires an average of 3-5 hours of autonomous work from the student, depending on their interests, profile, and experience (see Figure 1).

## **Work Phases**

The construction of this strategy was divided into four phases:

## **Exploratory Phase**

This phase took place from August 2022 to July 2023 and included analyzing the needs and challenges of the potential user community through in-person training sessions held in various cities across Colombia. During this phase, materials were created to test content and activities with different groups in five training sessions, which brought together **nearly 400 participants in five Colombian cities**: Bogotá (the capital), Bucaramanga (center-north), Cali (southwest), Manizales (center), and Quibdó (Pacific region). In total, there were **14 days and over 170 hours of in-person training**. A notable achievement of this phase was the participation of women, which exceeded 70%.

This exploratory phase allowed for testing content and activities, as well as identifying the needs and expectations of the user community through training sessions in major cities and intermediate cities with more difficult access and limited resources. These training sessions helped to adjust and refine the educational materials, ensuring their effectiveness and relevance for various contexts and needs.

These theoretical and practical training sessions included **keynote lectures, practical exercises in the R programming language, and practical workshops applied to public health**. In this way, the training sessions combined the acquisition of theoretical knowledge with its practical application, allowing for an understanding of the presented concepts, as well as the necessary skills to apply this knowledge in real situations and public health challenges.

## **Design and Development Phase**

During this phase, carried out between March and November 2023, the initial units of the virtual course were developed. This phase included content creation and instructional design of the initial units. The instructional design process incorporated the needs and lessons observed in the Exploratory Phase to generate a more efficient, active, and engaging learning experience. Finally, this phase included the production of educational resources such as infographics, videos, podcasts, among others.

**In total, we created 57 educational resources**: 17 videos, including diagrammed videos, interviews with specialists, tutorials, and explanatory videos. Additionally, we created 10 animated diagrams, 15 interactive presentations, 2 infographics, 2 documents, 3 forums, 1 podcast, 3 R exercises, and 4 R challenges.

Furthermore, since the course adopts a comprehensive gender perspective in STEM and data science, it features the **use of inclusive language, balanced representation in images and voices, and a carefully developed graphic line to avoid the reproduction of stereotypes**. Additionally, the course highlights the contributions of historical figures of various genders, with the aim of inspiring students and fostering a more inclusive and equitable environment in these fields.

## **Pilot Phase**

During this phase, the pilot of the initial units of the **'Course in Data Science for Public Health and Infectious Disease Modeling'** [(Watch course demo)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjIA6R-eC54) was conducted on the open online course platform, based on open-source software, edX Edge. This phase took place between November and December 2023. A total of **223 people from 16 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean participated**, 57% of whom successfully completed the course. This pilot allowed for the evaluation of the content, educational resources, learning experience, learning objectives, and interaction with the platform.
